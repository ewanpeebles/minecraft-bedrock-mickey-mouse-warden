# INSTRUCTIONS FOR BEDROCK EDITION
In order to download the repository, click on the green (or blue in some cases) "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP" and select where to download.
After downloading, right-click the file and choose "Extract All...", and again, choose where to extract it. Double-click the file named "mickey-warden-bedrock.mcaddon" and Minecraft should start importing it.
Once you have imported it, create or edit a world, find the textures area, and add it. Once a warden is summoned, it will have the Mickey Mouse texture!

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR JAVA EDITION
<!-- Emery pls work on this -->
> Warning! may not be accurate. Needs further work.
