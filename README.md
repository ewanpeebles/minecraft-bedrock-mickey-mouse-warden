A texture pack to make the warden look like Mickey Mouse in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. After downloading, copy and paste the following into the file explorer:
```C:\Users\ewanr\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_resource_packs```

to implement it as a usable resource pack. Then, go to [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net) and copy and paste two uuids into the designated spots in the manifest.json file to give it a unique ID.
Your texture pack is ready!

Special thanks to Blockbench for texture developement.
